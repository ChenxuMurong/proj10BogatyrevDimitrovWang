# proj10BogatyrevDimitrovWang
#### Baron's notes:
 - I have integrated the bantam checker into the project. I think we are ready to implement enhancements now.
 - Remember to start a new branch before you start implementing your feature :)
   - I did not remove the "Compile & Run" and "Stop" button either because we will prolly use them for Java program conversion
